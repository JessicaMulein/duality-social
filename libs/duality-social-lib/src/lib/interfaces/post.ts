 * This interface represents a post, which is a piece of content that a user can create.
 * One post will consist of a minimum of two viewpoints- one from the user and one from the AI.
 * There may be additional "viewpoints" that are AI translations of either of the other viewpoints.
 * There is no point in keeping both source and rendered copies of translations, so we only keep rendered translations.
 * Source - Human
 * Rendered - Human
 * Source - AI
 * Rendered - AI
 * Rendered - AI Translation
 * It inherits from IHasID, which provides the id property, IHasCreation, which provides the createdAt and updatedAt properties, and IHasSoftDelete, which provides the deletedAt property.
