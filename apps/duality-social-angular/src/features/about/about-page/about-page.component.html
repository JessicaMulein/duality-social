              One of the weird political things that emerged since 2016 is the idea
              of everything needing to be presented with "both sides" of any issue.
              People said there need to be "both sides" of any issue, so here you
              can have it.
            </p>
            <p>
              When OpenAI became available to us, the creator had the idea that it
              might be interesting to have a social network where every post is
              presented with a roughly opposite view and tone. So, if you post "I
              love bacon", the "other side" might be "I hate bacon".
            </p>
            <p>
              This social network takes every post you make and presents it with the
              AI's idea of the Devil's Advocate view. Users then vote on which they
              think is the human's view (and logically the other is the AI's view).
            </p>
            <p>
              There is also a separate reaction (like, love, hug, sad, etc) you can
              make use of.
            </p>
            <p>
              This <b>&quot;</b>social network<b>&quot;</b> is an <b><i>experiment</i></b>,
              and an expensive one at that.
            </p>
            <p>
              OpenAI is relatively expensive, in addition to other database,
              hosting, bandwidth, and other overhead necessary for Duality Social to
              function.
            </p>
            <p>
              Duality Social is being presented as a Pay to Peek social experiment.
              We will create invitation codes with a limited number of uses, and you
              will be able to share those codes with your friends.

              In order for this site to continue to exist, these things need to
              happen:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>People need to use the site and enjoy it.</li>
              <li>People need to share the site with their friends.</li>
              <li>
                People need to pay enough for the site to at least break even.
              </li>
              <li>
                Members need to remember to respect one another, and to follow the
                <a href="https://openai.com/api/policies/service-terms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"
                  title="OpenAI Service Terms">terms and rules</a>
                we are bound to through our collective use of

              </li>
              <li>
                Members need to report bad behavior immediately. Reports on a post
                or user will be reviewed by the site administrators and appropriate
                action will be taken as soon as possible.
              </li>
              <li>
                * Reports on posts due to the AI's response may take down the post,
                but will not affect the user's account standing.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the Peek funds are sufficient, additional moderation staff may be
                hired to help with the review process.
              </li>
              <li>
                Members have a duty to report anything in breach of OpenAI's terms
                which will risk our ability to operate.
              </li>
              <li>Be good, enjoy the mystery.</li>

          <p><b>Above all, DualitySocial is <a class="digidefi-github"
                  href="https://github.com/Digital-Defiance/duality-social">Open Source</a>.</b>
          </p>
          <p>Digital Defiance is a <b>non-profit</b> registered in Washington State.</p>
          <p>Jessica Mulein is an employee of Microsoft, however this project is an independent
            work developed on private time on private hardware and made for the public good.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duality Social was originally born with the monthly Azure play money we get as employees,
            and then we got a Microsoft grant which provided us ample resources. You can use the
            source code of this game to make another one that quickly integrates with Azure. As this
            work is open source and non-profit, it should not be any conflict of interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, if the site costs more to exist than the grant money as well as the fees
            from OpenAI and any other overhead, it will have to be shut down unless donations are made.
            A formal donation process hasn't been established, but if you want to donate, please contact
            Jessica Mulein via email (jessica [at] digitaldefiance [dot] org).
          </p>
          <p>Once the initial invitation period is over, usage will have to be covered by donations,
             like when you go to a museum and you have to pay to get in.
